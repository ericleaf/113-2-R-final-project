If there is other relevant information put it below:

The data set does not contain the data of all of Taiwanese villages and vote data:

- The data of Yongfeng village (永豐村) of Pitou Township (埤頭鄉) of Changhua County are not contained because of the omission of original income data.
- The data of plains and mountain indigenous people of Chiayi City are not contained because they voted at a separated polling station.
- The data of Guangwu Village (光武里) and Zhongyi Village (忠義里) of Daliao District (大寮區) of Kaohsiung City is not contained because Guangwu Village was merged in Zhongyi Village in 2022.
- The data of other villages of Lienchiang County except Jieshou Village (介壽村) of Nangan Township (南竿鄉) are not contained because these villages were merged with other villages to set up polling stations.

Some data are modified:

- The data of Dingcuo Village (頂厝里) of Lukang Township (鹿港鎮) of Changhua County include the data of Ludong Village (鹿東里) and Luhe Village (鹿和里) because their income data are still calculated in combination in 2021 but Ludong Village and Luhe Village was separated from Dingcuo Village in 2022.
- The data of Wangmei Village (望美村) of Xinyi Township (信義鄉) of Nantou County include the data of Kalibuan Village (卡里布安村) because their income data are still calculated in combination in 2021 but the latter was separated from the former in 2022.
